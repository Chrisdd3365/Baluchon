# Baluchon

## Description:

Baluchon is an app developed on Swift 4 for travel purposes. This app has 3 differents functionalities:

- Currency change: to allow the user to convert a value based in EUR into differents currencies

- Translation: to allow the user to translate a word or a sentence or even a text from french to english

- Weather: to allow the user to check the weather of Paris and New York by displaying informations about
            the temperature and the weather's forecast


## New Functionnality:

Baluchon is a responsive app in portrait mode but I decided to implement a responsive design in landscape mode too.


## What I used:

- MVC Pattern
- API Rest Request such as: Fixer.io, Google Translate, Yahoo Weather
- Implementing a TabBar Controller
- Implementing, customizing and set in alphabetic order the currencies into a Picker View 
- Implementing different kind of keyboards when tapping on a Text Field and to allow user to dismiss them by tapping the screen
- Implementing a placeholder into a Text View
- Securing the buttons by using isEnabled property of UIButton


## Running the tests:

Testing Model with Unit Test by testing API request with Double Fake URL Session and Fake Response Data 


## Requirements:
